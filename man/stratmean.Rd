\title{Calculate stratified mean biomass and abundance}
\usage{
stratmean(
  survdat,
  groups = "all",
  group.col = "SVSPP",
  merge.sex = T,
  sex.col = "CATCHSEX",
  strat.col = "STRATUM",
  poststrat = F,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{survdat}{NEFSC survey data generated by Survdat.R and modified by stratprep().}

\item{groups}{Specify a particular group you want.  The default "all" will calculate
means for all groups in the group.col.}

\item{group.col}{Column of survdat upon which the means are based (i.e. SVSPP).}

\item{merge.sex}{Logical value to merge sexed species such as dogfish.}

\item{sex.col}{Column of survdat containing the sex of the group.  If merge.sex is true,
this parameter is ignored.}

\item{poststrat}{Logical value indicating whether the original strata design was
used or not.  Changes the calculation for variance.}

\item{nsta.col}{Column of survdat containing the number of stations per strata.}

\item{area.wgt}{Column of survdat containing the strata weights.}

\item{weight}{Column of survdat containing the biomass per station.}

\item{number}{Column of survdat containing the abundance per station.}

\item{strata.col}{Column of survdat containing strata designations.}
}
\value{
Returns a table with stratified mean biomass and abundance for each group
indicated by the group.col parameter.  In addition, the variance and standard error
for both means are provided.
}
\description{
Calculates the stratified mean biomass and abundance.  Also calculates the associated
variance and standard error.  Requires you to run stratprep() to survdat object beforehand.
