\title{Calculate the estimate of total biomass and abundance}
\usage{
swept_area(
  prepData,
  stratmeanData,
  q = NULL,
  a = 0.0384,
  areaDescription,
  groupDescription = "SVSPP"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{Table of survey catchability with a column of group names and a column of
catchabilities.  If not provided, assumes a q of 1 for each group (Minimum swept area
estimates).}

\item{a}{The average swept area of the trawl.  Default value is the swept area of a
standard NOAA Ship Albatross IV tow.}

\item{areaDescription}{Column of survdat containing strata designations.}

\item{groupDescription}{Column of survdat upon which the totals are based (i.e. SVSPP).}

\item{survdat}{NEFSC survey data generated by Survdat.R and modified by stratprep().}

\item{stratmean}{Output from strat_mean().}
}
\value{
Returns a table with the estimates of total biomass and abundance as well as
the stratified mean biomass and abundance for each group indicated by the groupDescription
parameter.  In addition, the variance of the totals and variance and standard error
for both means are provided.
}
\description{
Calculates the estimate of total biomass and abundance using the swept area.
Variance of the estimate is also calculated.  Requires the outputs from both
the stratprep and stratmean functions.
