\usage{
strat_prep(
  surveyData,
  areaPolygon = "NEFSC strata",
  areaDescription = "STRATA",
  filterByArea = "all",
  filterBySeason = "all"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{surveyData}{Data table. NEFSC survey data generated by \code{get_survdat_data.R}}

\item{areaPolygon}{sf object. Name of the object containing the shapefile.}

\item{areaDescription}{Character String. Column name from \code{areaPolygon}
that contains the strata designations.}

\item{filterByArea}{Numeric vector. Set of areas to subset from the 
\code{areaDescription} of the \code{areaPolygon}.}

\item{filterBySeason}{Character string. Which seasons of the \code{surveyData}
should be included.  Choices include "SPRING", "FALL", or "all".}
}
\value{
Returns a prepSurvey data object with added columns for the number of 
 tows (ntows) and stratum weights (W.h).
}
\description{
Calculates the number of tows per strata and strata weight.  Run before
subsetting the data by species of interest to ensure all stations are accounted.
