\title{Calculate stratified mean biomass and abundance}
\usage{
stratmean(survdat, groups = "all", group.col, strat.col, nsta.col = "ntows",
  area.wgt = "W.h", weight = "BIOMASS", number = "ABUNDANCE")
}
\arguments{
\item{survdat}{NEFSC survey data generated by Survdat.R and modified by stratprep().}

\item{groups}{Specify a particular group you want.  The default "all" will calculate
means for all groups in the group.col.}

\item{group.col}{Column of survdat upon which the means are based (i.e. SVSPP).}

\item{nsta.col}{Column of survdat containing the number of stations per strata.}

\item{area.wgt}{Column of survdat containing the strata weights.}

\item{weight}{Column of survdat containing the biomass per station.}

\item{number}{Column of survdat containing the abundance per station.}

\item{strata.col}{Column of survdat containing strata designations.}
}
\value{
Returns a table with stratified mean biomass and abundance for each group
indicated by the group.col parameter.  In addition, the variance and standard error
for both means are provided.
}
\description{
Calculates the stratified mean biomass and abundance.  Also calculates the associated
variance and standard error.  Requires you to run stratprep() to survdat object beforehand.
